This is an implementation of simple leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron model and its dynamics response to various types of inputs. The file implements

1. simulation of the LIF neuron model.

2. the code for LIF neuron with external inputs, such as direct currents, Gaussian white noise, and Poisson spike trains, etc.

3. behaviour of different inputs affect the LIF neuron’s output such as firing rate and spike time irregularity.
