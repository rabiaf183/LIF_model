This is an implementation of simple leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron model its dynamics response to various types of inputs such as:

simulation of the LIF neuron model

drive the LIF neuron with external inputs, such as direct currents, Gaussian white noise, and Poisson spike trains, etc.

how different inputs affect the LIF neuron’s output (firing rate and spike time irregularity)
